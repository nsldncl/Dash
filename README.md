# Dash

This repository contains interactive dashboards built with Dash. These dashboards provide data visualization and insights for various datasets, and can be easily accessed locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the dashboards, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Plotly
- Dash

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To launch the dashboards, follow these steps:

Run the Python script for the desired dashboard:

```bash
python file_name.py
```

Once the script is running, you will see output similar to: ```Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/```

Open your preferred web browser and go to the URL to view the dashboard. Alternatively, you can use `localhost:8050` in your browser's address bar.
